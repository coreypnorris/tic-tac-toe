##Tic-Tac-Toe

####This is a javascript app for playing tic-tac-toe

To use it just download the zip file and open the index.html file in your web browser of choice. Then just click a square and youâ€™re started.

I built this project while I was a student at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe) was meant to stretch the limits of our object-oriented design skills. It was much harder to solve than the [address book](https://github.com/coreypnorris/address-book) or [expense tracker](https://github.com/coreypnorris/expense-tracker) and forced us to think in creative and unobvious ways about javascript and object-oriented design.
